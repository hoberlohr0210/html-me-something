            <h1>Cairo</h1>
                <p>Our first stop was Cairo, Egypt. This was the very first international city I'd ever visited. It was stark &amp; beautiful 
                    &amp; undeniably foreign. We certainly weren't in Missouri anymore! Our guide, Ezzat, eagerly showed us the wonders of this ancient city.
                    We sampled oils, coffee and falafel; we took a sunset boat ride on the Nile River; we even tried smoking hookah. Most excitingly, though,
                    was our trip to the Pyramids of Giza. We were fortunate enough to actually enter one of these Egyptian tombs. I will never forget the weighty 
                    presence of the surrounding stones as I walked into the heart of the pyramid. It was truly amazing!</p>

            <h1>Luxor</h1>
                <p>After Cairo, we took a somewhat miserable overnight train to the city of Luxor. However, the misfortunes of our journey were quickly 
                    forgotten as we started to explore our new destination. We visited several ancient sites, including the Temple of Hatshepsut,
                    The Valley of the Kings, and the ruins of Karnak. The heat of the sun was punishing, but our awe could not be withered away. Karnak,
                    in particular, was a vast complex with a plethora of heiroglyphics, statues, pillars and monuments that was ours to explore. We didn't
                    waste a second!</p>

            <h1>Petra</h1>
                <p>Our next stop saw us traveling in the footsteps of Indiana Jones. Words can hardly describe the wonder I felt when we came
                    upon the infamous Treasury. It is a magnificent structure that has resisted the ravages of time and bandits; but it was only
                    the beginning of what Petra had to offer. We continued on into the desert cliffs and soon entered the ruins of the ancient city.
                    I hadn't realized the sheer amount of history there was to explore. It was our playground! There were no warning signs or caution
                    tape. All you needed was your hiking boots, a bottle of water and a little common sense and you were free to climb all over the city.
                    It was exhausting and exhilirating!</p>

            <h1>Jerusalem</h1>
                <p>After Petra we finally made our way to the magnificent city of Jerusalem. Here, our days were puncuatated by the Muslim call to
                    prayer, which echoed throughout the city over speakers. Everwhere we walked brought new sights, smells and sounds. The cobblestone
                    streets were absolutely bursting with life. We stocked up on souvenirs and enjoyed the novelity of bartering for the price. We
                    visited many of the holiest sites in the world, including The Wailing Wall, The Dome of the Rock, The Temple of Jerusalem and
                    much more. The diverse population was astounding, and many citizens were happy to speak with a group of traveling students. 
                    The experiences we had here were truly once in a lifetime.</p>

            <h1>Bethlehem</h1> 
                <p>Our journey ended in the holy city of Bethlehem. Here, we not only visited biblical sites, but also spoke with Palestinian
                    people about their struggle to remain a recognized country. The political situation was blatant; there was no ignoring the
                    giant stone wall that surrounded the city, or the Israeli soldiers that patrolled the perimeter. It was an eye opening experience
                    for many of us. Our stay here involved a lot of reflection as we visited piligrimage sites such as the birth place of Jesus Christ.
                    It was an unforgettable visit for all of us.</p>
