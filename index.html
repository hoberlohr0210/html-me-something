        <p>During the summer of 2011 I had the amazing opportunity to go to the Middle East. Specifically, we went to Egypt, Jordan, Israel and Palestine.</p>

            <h1>Cairo</h1>
                <p>Our first stop was Cairo, Egypt. This was the very first international city I'd ever visited. It was stark &amp; beautiful<br> 
                    &amp; undeniably foreign. We certainly weren't in Missouri anymore! Our guide, Ezzat, eagerly showed us the wonders of this ancient city.<br>
                    We sampled oils, coffee and falafel; we took a sunset boat ride on the Nile River; we even tried smoking hookah. Most excitingly, though,<br>
                    was our trip to the Pyramids of Giza. We were fortunate enough to actually enter one of these Egyptian tombs. I will never forget the weighty <br>
                    presence of the surrounding stones as I walked into the heart of the pyramid. It was truly amazing!</p>

            <h1>Luxor</h1>
                <p>After Cairo, we took a somewhat miserable overnight train to the city of Luxor. However, the misfortunes of our journey were quickly <br>
                    forgotten as we started to explore our new destination. We visited several ancient sites, including the Temple of Hatshepsut,<br>
                    The Valley of the Kings, and the ruins of Karnak. The heat of the sun was punishing, but our awe could not be withered away. Karnak,<br>
                    in particular, was a vast complex with a plethora of heiroglyphics, statues, pillars and monuments that was ours to explore. We didn't<br>
                    waste a second!</p>

            <h1>Petra</h1>
                <p>Our next stop saw us traveling in the footsteps of Indiana Jones. Words can hardly describe the wonder I felt when we came<br>
                    upon the infamous Treasury. It is a magnificent structure that has resisted the ravages of time and bandits; but it was only<br>
                    the beginning of what Petra had to offer. We continued on into the desert cliffs and soon entered the ruins of the ancient city.<br>
                    I hadn't realized the sheer amount of history there was to explore. It was our playground! There were no warning signs or caution<br>
                    tape. All you needed was your hiking boots, a bottle of water and a little common sense and you were free to climb all over the city.<br>
                    It was exhausting and exhilirating!</p>

            <h1>Jerusalem</h1>
                <p>After Petra we finally made our way to the magnificent city of Jerusalem. Here, our days were puncuatated by the Muslim call to<br>
                    prayer, which echoed throughout the city over speakers. Everwhere we walked brought new sights, smells and sounds. The cobblestone<br>
                    streets were absolutely bursting with life. We stocked up on souvenirs and enjoyed the novelity of bartering for the price. We<br>
                    visited many of the holiest sites in the world, including The Wailing Wall, The Dome of the Rock, The Temple of Jerusalem and<br>
                    much more. The diverse population was astounding, and many citizens were happy to speak with a group of traveling students. <br>
                    The experiences we had here were truly once in a lifetime.</p>

            <h1>Bethlehem</h1> 
                <p>Our journey ended in the holy city of Bethlehem. Here, we not only visited biblical sites, but also spoke with Palestinian<br>
                    people about their struggle to remain a recognized country. The political situation was blatant; there was no ignoring the<br>
                    giant stone wall that surrounded the city, or the Israeli soldiers that patrolled the perimeter. It was an eye opening experience<br>
                    for many of us. Our stay here involved a lot of reflection as we visited piligrimage sites such as the birth place of Jesus Christ.<br>
                    It was an unforgettable visit for all of us.</p>
